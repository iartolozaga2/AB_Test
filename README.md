CONTENTS OF THIS REPOSITORY:
- AB_Testing subfolder: Contains a Katalon project structure which can be imported to test the automated behaviors we programmed for each of the files. If only a quick visual check is needed, the route for the actual test files is \AB_Testing\scripts. WARNING: If the Katalon Tests (AB_Testing subfolder) want to be tested, the file import route in the test scripts should be changed to the directory in which the test files have been saved. Right now they are set to the local route in one of our PCs.
